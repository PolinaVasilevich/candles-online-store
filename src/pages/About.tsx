          <b>Brendle</b> is an independent fragrance company from London founded

          The entire Brendle collection is
          <b> vegan, cruelty-free, and phthalate-free</b> â€” always. All of our
          candles are made with 100% domestically-grown soy wax. While our
          production methods have improved over the years, something that hasn't
          changed about Brendle products is the people behind them. All of our
          products are developed, produced, tested, packed, and shipped by our
          team out of our warehouse in London, UK.
